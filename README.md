# Ding Dong

A game about motion and movement, pixel and effects.

The original intention was to play the game with the trajectory of a ping pong ball. You had to play the game with a game of ping pong. Now you play with your body or whatever you want.

The project is still work in progress, needs playtests and gameplay adjustments.
